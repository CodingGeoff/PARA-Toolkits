## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Create Configuration Files:**

   * In the same directory as the application, create a file named `config.json`. Add the following, pointing to where you want your PARA folders to live:
     ```json
     {
       "base_directory": "C:/Users/YourUser/Documents/MyPARA"
     }
     ```
   * Create another file named `rules.json` to define your automations (or leave it as an empty list `[]` if you don't need any yet):
     ```json
     [
       {
         "category": "Resources",
         "condition_type": "extension",
         "condition_value": ".pdf",
         "action": "subfolder",
         "action_value": "PDFs"
       }
     ]
     ```
2. **Run the Application:**

   * Execute the `ParaManager.exe` file (if packaged) or run the script with Python. The application will automatically create the `1_Projects`, `2_Areas`, etc., folders in your specified base directory.
3. **Organize\!**

   * Start dragging files and folders into the drop zones or directly into the file tree to begin organizing.
