## ‚ú® Ultimate Features

This application is engineered for power users who demand clarity, control, and automation. It transforms the PARA method from a concept into a seamless, interactive experience.

* **üóÇÔ∏è Hybrid Drag & Drop Interface**
  * **Quick-File Zones:** Four large, always-visible drop zones at the top for instantly filing items into your **P**rojects, **A**reas, **R**esources, or **A**rchives.
  * **Precision Drops:** Drag files directly onto any folder within the detailed file browser for granular control.

* **ü§ñ Intelligent Automation Engine**
  * Create custom rules in a simple settings panel to automatically process your files upon dropping them.
  * **Auto-Prefixing:** Add prefixes to filenames based on keywords (e.g., add `[REPORT]` to any file containing "summary").
  * **Auto-Subfolding:** Move files into specific subfolders based on their file type (e.g., all `.pdf` files go into a "PDFs" folder).

* **üëÅÔ∏è Transparent Deduplication Workflow**
  * **No More Black Boxes:** When moving files into a non-empty folder, the app clearly explains that duplicates might occur.
  * **User-Driven Choices:** You are given the choice between a **Smart Scan** (to check file content for duplicates) or a **Fast Move** (to simply move and rename any conflicts).
  * **Integrated Selection:** Instead of a separate pop-up, "Smart Scan" mode overlays **interactive checkboxes** directly onto the main file tree, so you can select which destination files to check against without losing context.

* **‚ö° Fine-Grained Progress & Logging**
  * A single, continuous progress bar shows the total workload and updates with the **name of the specific file** currently being processed (hashed, checked, or moved).
  * A comprehensive log records every key action, from starting a hash to finding a duplicate and processing the user's final choice. The **Log Viewer** allows you to review these detailed logs at any time.

* **üå≥ Full File & System Control**
  * **Full Context Menu:** Right-click any file or folder to Open, Show in Explorer, Rename, or Delete.
  * **Safe Deletion:** All deleted items are sent to the system's **Recycle Bin (or Trash)**, ensuring you can always recover from a mistake.
  * **Interactive Duplicate Resolution:** In the final confirmation dialog, you can right-click on both the source and conflicting destination files to **open their locations directly** for easy inspection before making a decision.

* **‚öôÔ∏è Effortless Configuration**
  * A clean, visual settings panel allows you to set your main PARA directory and manage all automation rules with interactive dropdowns and text fields.
  * **Smart Migration:** If you ever change your PARA base directory, the app offers to **automatically move all existing folders and their contents** to the new location.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Run the Application:**
    * Execute `ParaManager.exe` (or your platform's equivalent).
    * On first launch, you'll see a welcome screen. Click "Open Settings."

2. **Set Your Base Directory:**
    * In the settings window, click "Browse..." and choose an empty folder where you want your PARA structure to live (e.g., `C:/Users/YourUser/Documents/MyPARA`).
    * Click "Save & Close." The application will automatically create the `1_Projects`, `2_Areas`, `3_Resources`, and `4_Archives` folders for you.

3. **(Optional) Add Automation Rules:**
    * Open settings again to add rules. For example, to move all `.pdf` files dropped into "Resources" to a "PDFs" subfolder:
        * **Category:** Resources
        * **Condition Type:** extension
        * **Condition Value:** .pdf
        * **Action:** subfolder
        * **Action Value:** PDFs

4. **Organize!**
    * You're all set! Start dragging files and folders into the drop zones or directly into the file tree to experience automated, intelligent organization.
