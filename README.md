## ‚ú® Ultimate Features

This application is engineered for power users who demand clarity, control, and automation. It transforms the PARA method from a concept into a seamless, interactive experience.

* **üóÇÔ∏è Hybrid Drag & Drop Interface**
  * **Quick-File Zones:** Four large, always-visible drop zones at the top for instantly filing items into your **P**rojects, **A**reas, **R**esources, or **A**rchives.
  * **Precision Drops:** Drag files directly onto any folder within the detailed file browser for granular control.

* **ü§ñ Intelligent Automation Engine**
  * Create custom rules in a simple settings panel to automatically process your files upon dropping them.
  * **Auto-Prefixing:** Add prefixes to filenames based on keywords (e.g., add `[REPORT]` to any file containing "summary").
  * **Auto-Subfolding:** Move files into specific subfolders based on their file type (e.g., all `.pdf` files go into a "PDFs" folder).

* **üëÅÔ∏è Transparent Deduplication Workflow**
  * **No More Black Boxes:** When moving files into a non-empty folder, the app clearly explains that duplicates might occur.
  * **User-Driven Choices:** You are given the choice between a **Smart Scan** (to check file content for duplicates) or a **Fast Move** (to simply move and rename any conflicts).
  * **Integrated Selection:** Instead of a separate pop-up, "Smart Scan" mode overlays **interactive checkboxes** directly onto the main file tree, so you can select which destination files to check against without losing context.

* **‚ö° Fine-Grained Progress & Logging**
  * A single, continuous progress bar shows the total workload and updates with the **name of the specific file** currently being processed (hashed, checked, or moved).
  * A comprehensive log records every key action, from starting a hash to finding a duplicate and processing the user's final choice. The **Log Viewer** allows you to review these detailed logs at any time.

* **üå≥ Full File & System Control**
  * **Full Context Menu:** Right-click any file or folder to Open, Show in Explorer, Rename, or Delete.
  * **Safe Deletion:** All deleted items are sent to the system's **Recycle Bin (or Trash)**, ensuring you can always recover from a mistake.
  * **Interactive Duplicate Resolution:** In the final confirmation dialog, you can right-click on both the source and conflicting destination files to **open their locations directly** for easy inspection before making a decision.

* **‚öôÔ∏è Effortless Configuration**
  * A clean, visual settings panel allows you to set your main PARA directory and manage all automation rules with interactive dropdowns and text fields.
  * **Smart Migration:** If you ever change your PARA base directory, the app offers to **automatically move all existing folders and their contents** to the new location.

### üóÇÔ∏è Core Organization

* **PARA Drop Zones:** Quickly sort files into Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives with dedicated drag-and-drop targets.
* **Custom Folder Mode:** Go beyond PARA and analyze any folder on your system with the same powerful tools. (*GPU acceleration required for this mode*).
* **Full File System View:** A complete tree view for Browse, creating, renaming, and deleting files and folders.
* **Rich Context Menus:** Right-click on any file or folder to open it, show it in the native file explorer, copy its path, and more.

### üß† Intelligent Duplicate Finder

* **Developer-Aware Engine:** The scanner is smart enough to automatically ignore common development folders (`.git`, `node_modules`, `venv`), configuration files (`package.json`, `Dockerfile`), and library data (`nltk_data`, `.cache/huggingface`).
* **User-Configurable Rules:** Fine-tune the scanner's behavior by editing a simple `scan_rules.json` file.
* **Retention Scoring:** An advanced algorithm scores each file in a duplicate set to determine which one is most likely the "original" you want to keep.
* **One-Click Cleanup:** The results dialog pre-selects the best file to keep and marks all others for deletion, allowing for safe and confident one-click cleanup.
* **Safe Deletion:** All deleted items are grouped into a single, timestamped folder which is then moved to the Recycling Bin, preventing accidental data loss and making restoration easy.

### ‚ö° Performance & Efficiency

* **Intelligent Hash Caching:** The application remembers the hashes of unchanged files. Subsequent scans are dramatically faster, often reducing scan times from minutes to seconds.
* **Auto-Pruning Cache:** The hash cache automatically cleans itself, removing entries for files that no longer exist.
* **Optional GPU Acceleration:** For users with compatible NVIDIA GPUs (and the `numba` library), hashing of very large files can be hardware-accelerated.
* **Multi-threaded Operations:** All long-running tasks (scanning, moving, indexing) are performed on a background thread to keep the UI responsive.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Customization & Usability

* **Automated Sorting Rules:** Create custom rules in `rules.json` to automatically move files to subfolders or add prefixes based on file type or keywords.
* **Custom Icons:** Personalize the PARA category icons in the Settings dialog.
* **Advanced Search:** Search results are scored and sorted by relevance. Matched keywords are highlighted for clarity.
* **Persistent Data:** All settings, rules, and cache files are stored safely in your user's application data directory, ensuring they persist even with single-file executable builds.

## Installation

### For Users (Recommended)

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/CodingGeoff/Para-Toolkits/releases) page.
2. Download the `ParaManager.exe` file from the latest release.
3. Run the executable. No installation is required.

On first run, the application will create a folder in your user's data directory to store settings and logs.

### For Developers (Running from Source)

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/CodingGeoff/Para-Toolkits.git](https://github.com/CodingGeoff/Para-tookits.git)
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python para_manager.py
    ```

## Configuration

The application uses several JSON files for configuration, which are created on the first run in your user's data directory. You can edit these to customize behavior:

* `config.json`: Main settings, including operating mode and custom paths.
* `rules.json`: Automation rules for sorting dropped files.
* `scan_rules.json`: Exclusion rules for the Developer-Aware scanner.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Run the Application:**
    * Execute `ParaManager.exe` (or your platform's equivalent).
    * On first launch, you'll see a welcome screen. Click "Open Settings."

2. **Set Your Base Directory:**
    * In the settings window, click "Browse..." and choose an empty folder where you want your PARA structure to live (e.g., `C:/Users/YourUser/Documents/`).
    * Click "Save & Close." The application will automatically create the `1_Projects`, `2_Areas`, `3_Resources`, and `4_Archives` folders for you.

3. **(Optional) Add Automation Rules:**
    * Open settings again to add rules. For example, to move all `.pdf` files dropped into "Resources" to a "PDFs" subfolder:
        * **Category:** Resources
        * **Condition Type:** extension
        * **Condition Value:** .pdf
        * **Action:** subfolder
        * **Action Value:** PDFs

4. **Organize!**
    * You're all set! Start dragging files and folders into the drop zones or directly into the file tree to experience automated, intelligent organization.
